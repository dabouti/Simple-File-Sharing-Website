1. Created a feature where users can directly rename their existing files from their personal directory. The renaming feature is shown below.

2. When a user uploads a file with the same name as an existing file in the directory, rather than overwriting the old file or triggering an error, the system prefixes '1-' to the file name. Subsequent uploads with identical names result in an incrementing numerical prefix, such as '2-', '3-', and so on.

3. We implemented Bootstrap, a front-end framework, into our website design. We did some experiments with the website grids and the colors of our buttons and page layouts to ensure that our website is visually appealing.

In Bootstrap, these classes create rows and columns inside a container to align and organize the components.

These classes styles the form and changes the color of the button to a color you want from the variety of options provided by Bootstrap.
